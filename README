Socket Wrench - WebSockets made easy

Socket Wrench consists of two parts, a server written in Sinatra/em-websocket and a client side javascript library.
Socket wrench makes it dead simple to write websocket driven applications that take advantage of this awesome technology.

TODO: need to fix syntax for declaring the protocols/commands
TODO: Support for multiple "channels" within a protocol to allow for something like a chat system with multiple rooms

High level example for a chat room:

Protocol: chat
Commands: join, leave, update

Server side (this is pseudo code):

Protocol chat, on join do |data|
    broadcast to all clients that data.username joined
end

Protocol chat, on leave do |data|
    broadcast to all clients that data.username left the room
    remove the client from the client list
end

Protocol chat, on update do |data|
    broadcast to all clients that data.username sent message data.message
end
